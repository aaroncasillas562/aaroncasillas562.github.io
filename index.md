### CPSC 120 

* Lab 5 

  Lab 5, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because the code for this lab was so simple yet showed me how you can switch up different variables in a function to have a different output. Also, figuring out how to make a variable was a part of this lab. In this lab we were able to make different kinds of sandwiches which was fun.

* Lab 7, part 1

  Lab 7, part 1 was a great lab showing me how you can use math in coding that can be used in all sorts of things. The lab was really interesting on how you can figure the amount of days between dates in time including the year also.

* lab 7, part 2 

  Lab 7, part 2 was definitely my favorite as I have always liked to play Blackjack and wondered how hard it would be to make the game from scratch by adding up the scores of the cards dealt . Once I finished the lab, I used it to play my friend and won a couple times. After this lab, I definitely want to code an AI in the future to play blackjack for me.
